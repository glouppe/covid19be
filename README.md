[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/glouppe/covid19be/master)

This repository gathers models of the COVID-19 epidemics in Belgium. It is maintained by researchers of ULi√®ge. 

Our goal is primarily to provide educational materials in order to better understand the mathematics behind models of epidemics and to sensitize everyone to the requirements of protection measures. 

**Disclaimer**: All models are wrong, but some are useful. Results presented across these notebooks should **not** be interpreted as crystal ball forecasts.
